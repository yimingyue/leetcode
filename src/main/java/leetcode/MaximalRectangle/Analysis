1. My solution
    Step 1:
    Simplify the problem: given a array, find the maximal area in the area with continuous '1'.
    then it just need to count the continuous 1 in the area.

    Step 2:
    for each row in the matrix, calculate the maximal area in the row for each element.
    then for the matrix
        0   1
        0   1
        0   1
        1   1
        1   1
    we can get
        0   1
        0   1
        0   1
        1   2
        1   2

    step 3:
    now we view the matrix vertically. in each column, for each element, we can calculate the largest area till this element.
    And this is the largest rectangle in histogram question. then we have:
        0   1
        0   2
        0   3
        1   4
        1   5
